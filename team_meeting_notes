Notes for Capstone Meeting

7/2/24

DUE DATE FOR EVERYTHING: August 9th (drop dead time)
INTERNAL DEADLINE: July 26th

-	What are the units of visibility/etc?
- Are the soldiers good at navigating?
- How does the soldiers' trust of the AI come into play? Or are they just getting orders?
- Can we predict where we will be going to war? Weather, terrain, etc?
- Can we evaluate ahead of time to evaluate less trusted AI stuff in the future while the soldiers are moving through stuff in the back?
- How does the terrain and weather affect the movement of the UGS?
- Can we learn as we go? Can we use some form of Bayseian (sp) logic to inform based on what we're seeing?
- Do we know, and does it change the value of human life, if we know what the mission goal is?
